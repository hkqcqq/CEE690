    "Each observation of an environmental variable in space $z(\\mathbf{x})$ can be interpreted as a single realization of a random variable $Z(\\mathbf{x})$. Where $\\mathbf{x}$ denotes the position in space of the observation. In a given finite region there can be an infinite number of locations $\\mathbf{x}$ and thus an infinite number of random variables $Z(\\mathbf{x})$. The set of all these random variables $Z(\\mathbf{x})$ constitutes a random process. For the remainder of this problem assume $Z_i = Z(\\mathbf{x})$ and $z_i = z(\\mathbf{x})$.\n",

    "Using the elevation data found in `/data/HW/HW4/mtdiablo_dem_sf.tif`, show that the upslope drainage area flowing out of the grid cell point i = 582 and j = 779 is 12,856,300 $m^2$. You will need to write up your own recursive algorithm to estimate upslope drainage area for this problem. You will want to use the d8 flow direction approach. In other words, assume that if a ball is dropped on a given grid cell it will follow the path of steepest descent (i.e., the highest slope) to one (and only one) adjacent cell. Note that the pixel size is 10 meters by 10 meters. Furthermore, you may assume that this data has already been sink-filled."
